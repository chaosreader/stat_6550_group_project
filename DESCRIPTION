Description: Our dataset was produced by an AI using digital particle image
    velocimetry or DPIV [Willert and Gharib, 1991] to count the level of bee
    activity outside a hive marked R 4 5. These csv files are part of the 
    output of Dr. Sarbajit Mukherjee during his dissertation at Utah State
    University. We have received permission of Dr. Kulyukin to use these files
    for time series analysis. The counts correspond to a 28 second period 
    recorded approximately every 15 minutes throughout the day. The monitors 
    shutdown at night and went off line several times throughout the season 
    leaving significant coverage gaps. In this package, we provide a script
    for cleaning and preparing the data for time-series analysis as well as
    some tools for providing analysis for the non-uniform series.
